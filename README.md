# Introduction

Welcome to this tutorial where I will guide you through the process of training a YOLOv8 model using a single notebook. In this tutorial, you will learn how to download an open dataset and automatically preprocess it with pandas, specifically utilizing Google Open Images for training. Moreover, I will demonstrate how to convert all the google images' labels into the YOLO format, making it easier to train your model effectively.
